Today I am going to say few points about college life. This passage may include dates for analysis purposes. This is for the purpose of cd assignment that has to be submitted on  Sept we as team started to work on this assignment from September 05, 2021 or September 05, 21. 

	I have joined college on August 09, 2019 unlike school life, College Life has  different experience, and  person needs to have this experience in his/her life.College Life exposes us to whole new experiences which we always dream of experiencing after our school life. Lucky are those who get the chance to enjoy their college life, as many people don't get this chance due to their circumstances or financial issues. 

	For every person, College Life has  different meaning. While some people spend their college life by partying with friends, others become more cautious about their career and study hard. Whatever the way, every individual enjoy their college life and always wish to relive that time once it is over. 

	Some examples of dates are June 03, 2020, also  March 6, 2021 and many more. I highly appreciate my team for their contributions and complete the assignment in time. They are Anirudh, Hardik and Himesh.
