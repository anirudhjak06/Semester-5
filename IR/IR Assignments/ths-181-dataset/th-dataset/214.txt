Bayern Munich won the Champions League for a sixth time by beating Paris St Germain 1-0 in Sunday's final thanks to a goal from former PSG youth academy graduate Kingsley Coman.France international Coman appeared at the back post to head home in the 59th minute, completing a sweeping move from Bayern.

The victory also completed a treble of trophies for Hansi Flick's side after they also won the Bundesliga and the German Cup.The Bayern coach opted to start with Coman instead of Ivan Perisic on the left flank and it was an inspired decision.Jerome Boateng was deemed fit to start in the Bayern central defence, having recovered from a knock picked up in the semi-final win over Olympique Lyonnais.PSG goalkeeper Keylor Navas returned to their starting lineup having recovered from injury.Neymar FoiledAfter a cagey opening, Neymar suddenly burst into life in the 18th minute, scampering into the box and firing off a left-foot shot but Neuer's outstretched leg foiled the Brazilian.Four minutes later Bayern's goal threat, Robert Lewandowski, was found in the box by a left wing cross from Alphonso Davies and given room to turn but his shot struck the post.PSG were certainly asking questions of the Bayern defence and the livewire Angel Di Maria, after a quick exchange on the edge of the area, created space for a shot but his effort, with his weaker right foot, flew high and wide.Bayern's gamble to start Boateng looked mistaken when he hobbled off in the 25th minute, being replaced by Niklas Suele.PSG's industrious midfielder Ander Herrera had a fierce effort from distance deflected wide, while at the other end Lewandowski's stooping header from close range forced a fine reflex save out of Navas.Mbappe, PSG's talented French World Cup-winning striker, should have done better just before the break when, after a smart one-two with Herrera, he shot straight at Neuer.It was a scrappy start to the second half with both sides struggling to find any composure but the game came alive just before the hour mark.After a well-worked move down the right Joshua Kimmich picked out Coman at the back post and he got behind Thilo Kehrer to head firmly into the bottom corner.
